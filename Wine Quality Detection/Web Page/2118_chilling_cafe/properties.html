	  <p>
	  The quality of wines have been given a ranking between 0-10 with 0 being the lowest and 10 being the highest ranking. The following barchart shows the number of wines under each category of ranking.
	  </p>
          <p>
	  Fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates and alcohol are all properties that influence the quality of wines. The effect of each of these properties on the overall quality is displayed in the boxplots below.

    🍷 Fixed acidity quantity roughly follow the same pattern except the wines rated 9. <br>
    🍷 Although establishing a pattern is difficult, it is seen that citric acid is on the lower side. <br>
    🍷 Chlorides are clearly lower for highly rated wines. <br>
    🍷 Residual sugar is mostly on the lower side for better wines. <br>
    🍷 Free sulfur dioxide and total sulfur dioxide are moderately correlated and their distribution agianst the quality of the wines are similar. Except the wines rated 4, usually the better wines have low sulfur dioxide.<br>
    🍷 Better wines on an average have lower density.<br>
    🍷 Higher pH is evident in wines having high quality.<br>
    🍷 Sulphates don't have clear differentiating pattern. <br>
    🍷 Better wines have on an average higher alcohol content.<br>
